 ## N-Puzzle Solver: C++, Priority Queues, Vectors, and Efficient Array Allocation

**Untangle the tiles and put them back in order!** 

**This repository showcases a C++ implementation of a solver for the N-Puzzle game.** It explores effective problem-solving techniques and efficient memory management, including:

* **Priority Queue for Heuristic Search:** Optimizes move exploration using a priority queue based on the Manhattan distance heuristic.
* **Vectors for Dynamic Data Structures:** Leverages vectors for flexible and efficient storage of game states and move paths.
* **Constant-Time Array Allocation:** Employs a custom array allocation strategy to achieve O(1) (constant-time) complexity for array operations, enhancing overall performance.

**Key Features:**

- Solves N-Puzzle configurations for various board sizes (N).
- Demonstrates informed search using a priority queue.
- Showcases efficient vector utilization for dynamic data management.
- Emphasizes memory optimization through custom array allocation.
- Prioritizes code readability and maintainability with clear comments and structure.

**Potential Applications:**

- Pathfinding in games and robotics
- Optimization problems in scheduling and logistics
- Decision-making in AI systems

**To Get Started:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable to solve N-Puzzle challenges.

**Explore, experiment, and contribute!**
